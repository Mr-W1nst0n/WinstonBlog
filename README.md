## Necessary Introduction
Let me get straight to the point: I'm **_not_** a developer by any means, I'm a Microsoft's Infrastructure/Application techie 🤫  
Because I wanted to launch my blogging career, I was looking to something different then an overused *WordPress* site.  
I'm passionate about IT and I wanted something youth to satisfy my ego! 🦄

While searching, I found a video Tutorial from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/javascriptmastery/" target="_blank">@JSMastery</a> and I immediately felt in love ❤️  
In one shot I had the opportunity to touch'n'learn 👇

- 📚 NextJS
- ⭐ GraphQL and GraphCMS
- 📚 Tailwind CSS
- 🔥 Vercel

For a guy with my background is like landing into another planet 🌎
